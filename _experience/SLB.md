<a href="https://www.slb.com">Schlumberger</a> is a multi-national oilfield services company that provides technology, expertise, and solutions for the exploration, production, and management of oil and gas resources. 
As a field operations engineer, my preliminary responsibilities were safe and efficient execution of offshore exploration and completion drilling operations.
Through the two years of experience, I learned to foster a service oriented team spirit with focus on safety and efficiency.
I worked at multiple countries including India, China, France, and Malaysia with people from diverse nationalities.
