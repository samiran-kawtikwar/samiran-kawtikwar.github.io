Wayfair is a comprehensive online marketplace for home goods and furniture. Renowned for its user-friendly platform and competitive pricing, Wayfair strategically manages its supply chain, ensuring efficient logistics and a diverse array of quality products.

Wayfairâ€™s Operations Research team is responsible for developing and implementing optimization models to improve the efficiency of its supply chain. As a part of the team, I worked on optimizing Wayfair's warehouse operations.
I was responsible to develop and implement MIP models to find the optimal headcount mix for different employee types in a warehouse. The project involved communicating with stakeholders to understand different aspects of warehouse operations and employee considerations.
The tool developed generated valuable insights for the workforce planning team and it was approved for pilot testing.
