[Grandpitstop](https://www.grandpitstop.com) specializes in providing innovative solutions for motorcycle maintenance and accessories. They develop products and services designed to enhance the efficiency, convenience, and safety of motorcycle riders.
As a product development intern, I headed the development of a product for bike riders to beat heating issues in peak tropical summer.
We applied for a joint [patent](https://www.ipindia.gov.in/writereaddata/Portal/IPOJournal/1_1530_1/Part-1.pdf) for the resulting product after rigorous designing, prototyping, and testing stages.
