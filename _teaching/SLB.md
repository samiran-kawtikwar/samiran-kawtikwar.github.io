[Schlumberger](https://www.slb.com) is a multi-national oilfield services company that provides technology, expertise, and solutions for the exploration, production, and management of oil and gas resources. 
As a field operations engineer, my preliminary responsibilities were safe and efficient execution of offshore exploration and completion drilling operations.
Through the two years of experience, I learned to foster a service oriented team spirit with focus on safety and efficiency.
I worked at multiple countries including India, China, France, and Malaysia with people from diverse nationalities.
Some of the clients I worked for:

1. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (**ONGC**) India Limited
2. Reliance India Limited (**RIL**)
3. Husky Oil China Limited (**HOCL**)
4.
