<div style="text-align: justify;">
The Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) is a widely applicable combinatorial optimization problem. HyLAC is a GPU implementation that achieves impressive performance improvements with a speedup of up to 6.14× over existing solutions and up to 22.59x for tiled instances. Outperforming existing solutions for sparse as well as dense problems
