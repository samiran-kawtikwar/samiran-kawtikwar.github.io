The Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) is a widely applicable combinatorial optimization problem. HyLAC is a GPU implemenatation that achieves impressive performance improvements with speedup of up to 6.14× over existing solutions and upto 22.59x for tiled instances. Outperforming existing solutions for sparse as well as dense problems
