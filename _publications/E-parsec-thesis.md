Subgraph enumeration is a vital problem in graph theory, facing scalability challenges due to increasing graph sizes. PARSEC, a GPU-based solution, utilizes Depth First Search and various optimizations to improve performance, achieving significant speedups of up to 4.6× across data graphs and 3.7× across all queries, with a maximum speedup of 14.6×.
