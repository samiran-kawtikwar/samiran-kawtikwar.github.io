I am currently pursuing PhD in Operations Research at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC). I completed my undergraduate degree in Production and Industrial Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi in 2018. I have worked at Schlumberger as a field operations engineer for 2 years. If you would like to learn more about me, please see my [resume](https://samiran-kawtikwar.github.io/files/Samiran-Kawtikwar-Resume.pdf).

My research interests lie at the intersection of high-performance computing and large-scale optimization. I mainly focus on utilizing Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate discrete optimization and graph algorithms to develop scalable solutions for large instances. So far, I have worked on the following problems:

1. GPU Accelerated Subgraph Enumeration \
   BEEP: **B**alanced **E**fficient **E**numeration in **P**arallel
2. GPU Accelerated solver for the Linear Assignment Problem \
   HyLAC: **H**ybrid **L**inear **A**ssignment solver in **C**UDA
3. GPU Accelerated Multi-Target Tracking \
   Multi-Target Tracking with GPU-Accelerated Data Association Engine
