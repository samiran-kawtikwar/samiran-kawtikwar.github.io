I am currently pursuing PhD in Operations Research at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC). I completed my undergraduate degree in Production and Industrial Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi in 2018. I have worked at Schlumberger as a field operations engineer for 2 years. If you would like to learn more about me, please see my [resume](files/Samiran-Kawtikwar-Resume.pdf).

My research interests lie at the intersection of high-performance computing and large-scale optimization. I mainly focus on utilizing Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate discrete optimization and graph algorithms to develop scalable solutions for large instances. I have developed a unique combination of CUDA skills with focus on parallel optimization and graph search techniques.
So far, I have worked on the following problems:

### 1. GPU Accelerated Subgraph Enumeration

BEEP: **B**alanced **E**fficient **E**numeration in **P**arallel \
 Sources: [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3605573.3605653), [slides](files/BEEP-ICPP23.pptx)

### 2. GPU Accelerated solver for the Linear Assignment Problem

HyLAC: **H**ybrid **L**inear **A**ssignment solver in **C**UDA \
 Sources: [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpdc.2024.104838), [slides](files/HyLAC-INFORMS23.pptx)

### 3. GPU Accelerated Multi-Target Tracking

### 4. GPU Accelerated Branch-and-Bound through Best First Search (In review)

A single kernel BnB framework in CUDA for solving combinatorial optimization problems. \
 Sources: [slides](files/BNB-INFORMS24.pptx), [published-code](https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.8283725.v1)

### 5. GPU Accelerated Crossovers Inspired by the Spiral Dynamics of PDHG (Ongoing)

A crossover algorithm inspired by the spiral dynamics of primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method for finding basic feasible solutions of LP from an interior solution. [slides](files/crossover-INFORMS25.pptx)
