I am currently pursuing PhD in Operations Research at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC). I completed my undergraduate degree in Production and Industrial Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi in 2018. I have worked at Schlumberger as a field operations engineer for 2 years. If you would like to learn more about me, please see my [resume](files/Samiran-Kawtikwar-Resume.pdf).

My research interests lie at the intersection of high-performance computing and large-scale optimization. I mainly focus on utilizing Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate discrete optimization and graph algorithms to develop scalable solutions for large instances. I have developed a unique combination of CUDA skills with focus on parallel optimization and graph search techniques.
So far, I have worked on the following problems:

1. GPU Accelerated Subgraph Enumeration [INFORMS '22 slides](files/BEEP-ICPP23.pptx)\
   BEEP: **B**alanced **E**fficient **E**numeration in **P**arallel
2. GPU Accelerated solver for the Linear Assignment Problem [INFORMS '23 slides](files/HyLAC-INFORMS23.pptx)\
   HyLAC: **H**ybrid **L**inear **A**ssignment solver in **C**UDA
3. GPU Accelerated Multi-Target Tracking [FUSION '23 slides](files/MTT-FUSION23.pptx)\
   Multi-Target Tracking with GPU-Accelerated Data Association Engine
4. GPU Accelerated Branch-and-Bound through Best First Search (In progress) [INFORMS '24 slides](files/BNB-INFORMS24.pptx)\
   A single kernel BnB framework in CUDA for solving combinatorial optimization problems.
